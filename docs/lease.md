# Machine leases (`leased`, `lease`)

`bellows-lease` schedules shared build machines: each machine runs one leased
job at a time, granted in order of priority, then merge-queue position, then
arrival. It is a separate daemon from `bellowsd` and has nothing to do with the
compiler cache.

```sh
leased --merge-queue-repo owner/name &      # one per scheduling host
lease run laptop --est 20m --label "PR 587 clippy" -- cargo clippy --workspace
lease hold desktop --est 30m --label "PR 579 desktop half" -- ./batch.sh
lease status
lease log --since 2h
```

## A lease is held by a connection

`lease run` connects to the daemon's Unix socket, waits for its grant, runs the
command in a new process group and reports the group to the daemon. The lease
lasts exactly as long as that connection:

- When the command exits, the client kills anything it left in its group and
  releases the lease.
- When the client is interrupted (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`), the
  administrator revokes the lease, or the daemon goes away, the client stops
  the job (`SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after 5 s).
- When the client itself dies (even by `SIGKILL`), the job dies with it: the
  job's leader has `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`, and the daemon kills the whole process
  group when the connection ends without a reported exit (`killed_orphan` in
  the log).

So a free machine never has a leased job still running on it. Restart `leased`
only when `lease status` shows no holders: a restart ends every lease.

`lease run` exits with the command's code, or 75 if the lease was refused or
lost before the command ran.

`--advisory` (or `LEASE_ADVISORY=1`) never waits: on a busy machine the
command runs anyway, unleased, and the abandoned request stays in the log. It
exists for a trial rollout next to manual scheduling.

## Sessions

`lease hold` grants a session and passes its command `LEASE_TOKEN` and
`LEASE_MACHINE`. A nested `lease run` on the same machine with that token runs
at once instead of queueing, so a multi-command batch is never interleaved with
other requests. `lease admin preempt ID` ends a session at its next command
boundary: running commands finish, and the next nested run is refused.

## CI sharing

`lease ci-start laptop --job ID` (from a CI runner's job-started hook) and
`lease ci-stop laptop --job ID` (job-completed) mark a CI job sharing the
machine. While one is active, grants on that machine still happen but carry the
reduced job count (`--ci-jobs`, default 12 instead of `--jobs` 24), exported to
the command as `LEASE_JOBS` and `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`. A registration nobody
stops expires after three hours.

## Administration

`lease admin` reads the daemon's admin token from its state directory
(`$XDG_STATE_HOME/bellows-lease/admin.token`, mode 0600):
`reorder ID POS`, `pause MACHINE`, `resume MACHINE`, `preempt ID`,
`reserve MACHINE --label TEXT --for 30m`, `unreserve MACHINE`, and `cancel ID`
(drops a queued request, or revokes a lease and stops its job). Every request,
grant, release, overrun (past 1.5× the estimate), CI registration and
administrative action is appended to `log.jsonl` in the same directory.

Leases are cooperative for commands started outside `lease`: they run, but
nothing schedules them.
