# Design note: caching linked outputs through the rustc wrapper

Status: implemented in protocol 6 (`store-v6`). This note was written before
the code. It records what the transparent wrapper keys, what it restores, and
which failure mode each rule guards against.

## Why declared actions and archives did not help

`bellows action run` and `bellows archive publish/restore` wrap a *whole*
command with explicit, workspace-relative inputs and outputs. The rustc wrapper
never produces either record. It sees one rustc invocation at a time and only
writes `ActionCandidate` records. Manifold agents use `bellows run -- cargo …`,
so `declared actions 0, archives 0` is expected. Final links, test harnesses,
build scripts, proc-macro crates and every crate carrying Cargo's propagated
`-L native=` paths were bypassed before any identity was computed.

This change keeps one mechanism. Every new output kind is an
`ActionCandidate`: a static key computed before compiling, plus a manifest of
inputs learned from the successful compile. Each input is re-verified before
any restore. The records use the same CAS blobs, the same L1/remote lookup,
the same single-flight leases, and the same eight-candidates-per-static-key
policy. Declared actions stay the explicit, sandboxed tool for whole commands.

## What is keyed

Static key (known before compiling). This part is unchanged:

- `rustc -vV`, normalized arguments (every `-C`, `--cfg`, `--test`, `-C lto`,
  `strip`, `debuginfo`, `split-debuginfo`, `opt-level`, `panic`, target and
  link-arg flags), relevant environment, and digests of the primary source and
  every `--extern` file, including proc-macro `.so`/`.dll` files.

New in the static key:

- Output kind (`library` or `linked`) and the key-format version.
- For linked outputs, the linker identity: the resolved linker program from
  `-C linker=` or the target default (`cc`, or `link.exe` on MSVC), its
  content digest, and its `--version`/`-v` banner. Linker-selection link args
  (`-fuse-ld=`, `-B`) are resolved the same way.
- `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` is no longer part of the static key. Its effect is
  visible in the arguments, and `-C incremental=` is excluded from the key
  (see Incremental).

Candidate manifest (learned from the compile, verified before every restore):

- Every file in rustc's dep-info, as before: sources, `include_*!` files,
  and files proc macros report through their expansions.
- Every `# env-dep:` entry. A value inside the workspace or target root is
  compared *normalized* (`$WORKSPACE/…`, `$TARGET/…`) when the leak scan is
  clean, and literally otherwise.
- For linked outputs, every file the linker reads. rustc writes the exact
  linker command with `--print link-args=<tmp>`, a file, so Cargo's stdout is
  untouched. From that command Bellows records:
  - every existing file argument (transitive rlibs, objects, `.lib`, linker
    and version scripts, including paths inside `-Wl,` and `--opt=`);
  - every candidate a `-l`/`name.lib` could resolve to in `-L`/`/LIBPATH:`
    directories, then `LIBRARY_PATH`/`LIB`, then the C driver's default search
    directories. Both `.so` and `.a` are recorded. This over-approximation
    means a library that changes, or appears earlier in the search order,
    invalidates the link. A GNU ld script is followed one level.
  - C runtime objects reported by the driver (`crt1.o`, `crti.o`, and so on).

  Paths inside the Rust sysroot are covered by the compiler identity and are
  skipped. Paths outside the recognized roots are stored as absolute
  `host_files`, which are valid only on a host with byte-identical files.
- For rlib compiles that accept `-L native=`/`-l`: every `-l static` library
  that rustc bundles, resolved in the given search paths.

## Leak scan (relocatability, requirements 2 and 4)

The miss path already compiles with `--remap-path-prefix` for the workspace
and target roots. After a successful compile, every captured output (rlib,
rmeta, executable, `.so`/`.dll`, `.pdb`, `.dwp`, `.wasm`) is scanned for every
spelling of the workspace root and the target root. The spellings are
canonical, as given, and on Windows with the verbatim prefix and forward
slashes. A remapped build of path-independent code contains none of them;
this was verified on fixtures and is byte-identical across checkout paths.

- **Clean.** The candidate is shareable across worktrees. Path-valued env-deps
  are stored normalized.
- **Leaked**, for example `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), …)`,
  `env!("OUT_DIR")` used as a value, or a proc macro that reads
  `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` through `std::env`. The candidate is pinned with
  `@bellows:root:$WORKSPACE`/`$TARGET` inputs holding the digest of this
  checkout's absolute roots, and env-deps are compared literally. It hits only
  in the same checkout path.

A binary restored into another worktree therefore never carries that
worktree's paths, and never carries another worktree's paths either.
Debuginfo, `file!()` and panic locations use `/bellows/workspace` and
`/bellows/target`, which are identical for every checkout. Paths that are
relative to Cargo's working directory, such as `file!()` for workspace
members, are unchanged.

## What is restored

For a linked unit with stem `S` (`{crate}{extra-filename}` or
`lib{crate}{extra}`), the candidate holds every regular file in `--out-dir`
that starts with `S` followed by `.` or end of name, and that rustc wrote
during this compile. rustc may produce the executable, `.exe`, `.pdb`, `.dwp`,
`.wasm`, `.so`, `.dll`, `.dll.lib`, `.dll.exp`, `.dylib` and `.d`. The
predicted primary output and `.d` must be present. A directory output such as
`.dSYM`, or unpacked `.dwo` files, stops capture safely.

Restore downloads and verifies every blob before writing anything, then writes
each file atomically with its executable bit. On Windows, a destination held
open by a running `.exe` or `.dll` is first renamed aside, which Windows
permits for mapped images, and swept later. Stdout and stderr are replayed as
for libraries.

## Incremental hybrid

`bellows run` no longer forces `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`. An invocation carrying
`-C incremental=` is looked up with the incremental argument removed from the
key.

- **Hit:** outputs are restored. rustc's incremental session is untouched and
  remains self-consistent.
- **Miss:** rustc runs *with* incremental. The result is published only when no
  session existed before the compile, meaning a from-scratch compile with no
  prior state. Edit-loop recompiles that reuse a session are never published,
  so incremental state from one checkout cannot reach another. (Implemented
  with a per-unit session directory; see below.)

## Proc-macro consumers (owner decision, 2026-09-30)

Direct `--extern` proc macros no longer bypass. Their `.so`/`.dll` digests are
already in the static key. Their expansions' tracked inputs (`include_*!`,
`env!`, `tracked_*`) are in dep-info, and the leak scan pins any expansion that
bakes a checkout path. The remaining risk is a proc macro that reads an
untracked file or environment variable and emits content, not a path, derived
from it. That risk already applies today to proc macros loaded through
re-exports (serde_derive through serde), and plain Cargo has the same
staleness. `explain` names the proc macros a restored result used.

## Failure modes guarded

| Requirement | Guard |
|---|---|
| 1. Link identity | Transitive rlibs, objects, scripts, resolved native libs and CRT objects from the real link command; linker binary digest and banner; link args in the key; `LIBRARY_PATH`/`LIB`/SDK environment in the key; LTO, strip and debuginfo flags in the key. |
| 2. Env and path capture | dep-info env-deps are verified. Normalized comparison only when the output contains no checkout path; otherwise literal comparison plus a root pin. |
| 3. All outputs, atomic | Discovery by unit stem and write time. The primary output and `.d` are required. All blobs are verified before the first write, and each file is written atomically with its mode. Windows running images are renamed aside. |
| 4. Relocatability | The miss compile is always remapped. The leak scan decides whether sharing is safe. |
| 5. Same test results | Measured on Manifold: uncached and cached pass/fail/ignored lists are diffed. |
| 6. Proc macros | Enabled with the owner's approval. Residual risk documented above. |

Anything the model cannot describe stays a visible bypass or capture fallback:
an unresolvable `-l`, a directory output, a response file, `-L all=`, profile
or plugin inputs, `save-temps`, a custom sysroot or target JSON, or
`target-cpu=native`.

## Changes made during implementation

Measurements on Manifold and the Windows desktop changed several details.
Each one keeps the guarantees above.

- **Linker identity by content, after linking.** Instead of a `--version`
  banner computed before every compile, the programs the link command
  actually uses are verified inputs: the driver, GCC's `collect2`, and the
  `ld`/`lld`/`mold` selected by `-fuse-ld=` and `-B` (or the driver's default),
  plus `link.exe` on MSVC. The static key keeps the arguments and `PATH`.
- **Per-unit incremental directories.** A crate's lib, test harness and
  binaries share Cargo's incremental directory and the `{crate}-` prefix, so a
  "session exists" check wrongly withheld 219 results in a fresh Manifold
  worktree. Each unit now gets `{crate}-bellows{extra}` beneath Cargo's
  directory, which makes "from scratch" exact and race-free.
- **Pin only the root that leaked.** For registry crates the "workspace" is the
  registry package directory, identical in every worktree. Pinning the
  target directory alongside it forced needless per-worktree rebuilds, for
  example `zstd-sys`.
- **`$CHECKOUT` root.** `flagship-game-bundle`'s nested Cargo build runs rustc
  from a subdirectory while inheriting the outer `OUT_DIR` and library paths.
  The directory where `bellows run/local` started is normalized, remapped,
  scanned and pinned like the other roots.
- **`$PROFILE` root.** `release` and Manifold's `test-fast` (which inherits it)
  give dependencies byte-identical rustc arguments; only
  `<target>/<profile>` differs. That directory is normalized and remapped to
  `/bellows/profile`, so both profiles share results.
- **Stable empty directories for procedural macros.** wit-bindgen's macro bakes
  its build script's (empty) `OUT_DIR` through `env!("DEBUG_OUTPUT_DIR")`. Its
  crate hash then differed per worktree and cascaded into every consumer.
  While compiling a proc-macro crate, a non-Cargo variable naming an empty
  directory inside the target directory is given a machine-wide empty
  directory instead. That is observably equivalent at compile time, the only
  time a macro runs.
- **Windows.** The canonical workspace is a verbatim `\\?\C:\…` path that never
  prefixed rustc's paths, so the protocol-5 workspace remap silently did
  nothing on Windows. Every spelling of each root is now remapped. Linker
  bookkeeping in `.pdb`, `.exp` and import `.lib` files (working directory,
  command line, module and output paths) does not pin a result; any other
  checkout path there does. Cargo omits `-C extra-filename` for MSVC
  executables and for `cdylib`/`dylib` packages, whose unhashed names are
  accepted.
- **Build-script runs** use the same candidate machinery through a launcher
  (see [local builds](local-builds.md#build-script-runs)). Nested Cargo target
  directories, marked by `CACHEDIR.TAG`, are excluded from stored `OUT_DIR`
  trees.
- **Descriptive `-Z` flags.** `-Zbuild-std` passes `-Zunstable-options` to every
  crate. That flag and a few others that only change what the arguments
  already describe are kept in the key instead of bypassing.
- **`BELLOWS_READ_ONLY=1`** restores verified results without publishing, for
  CI jobs that share a developer's service.
- **Memoized digests.** Files Bellows writes are recorded in the digest memo
  under their post-write identity, so link validation in a fresh worktree does
  not rehash every restored rlib. `rustc -vV` is memoized per concrete compiler
  binary, never for a rustup proxy.
