# Bellows operator runbook

This runbook covers a trusted, single-tenant production deployment of the
compiler cache. Bellows does not terminate TLS and is not a hostile
multi-tenant execution sandbox.

## Secure startup

Generate a high-entropy bearer token, store it in the CI secret manager, and
inject it into both server and clients as `BELLOWS_AUTH_TOKEN`. A listener on a
non-loopback address refuses to start without authentication. The escape hatch
`--allow-insecure-no-auth` is only for isolated disposable development
networks.

```bash
export BELLOWS_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
bellowsd \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:7878 \
  --data-dir /var/lib/bellows \
  --max-blob-mb 512 \
  --max-requests 128
```

Put a TLS reverse proxy or a private authenticated network in front of the
loopback service. Never place the plain HTTP listener directly on the public
internet. Only one `bellowsd` may own a data directory; a second process fails
at startup instead of risking split-brain leases.

The container listens on `0.0.0.0:7878`, so `BELLOWS_AUTH_TOKEN` is mandatory:

```bash
docker run --detach --name bellows \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --env BELLOWS_AUTH_TOKEN \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:7878:7878 \
  --volume bellows-data:/var/lib/bellows \
  bellows:VERSION
```

`GET /live` is an unauthenticated liveness-only endpoint used by the container
health check. Every `/v1/*` endpoint requires the token when authentication is
configured. Readiness is verified with `bellows doctor` from the same network
and credentials as CI.

## Backups and upgrades

The data directory is a disposable cache, not a system of record. Backups are
optional. If retained, stop the daemon with SIGTERM and wait for a clean exit
before snapshotting the volume. Atomic record publication and directory fsyncs
make ordinary process interruption recoverable; malformed records are moved to
`quarantine/` and become safe cache misses.

Bellows currently has no stable wire or on-disk compatibility guarantee. The
client and server must use the same `PROTOCOL_VERSION`. For an upgrade:

1. Stop CI jobs that publish to the service.
2. Send SIGTERM and wait for `bellowsd` to exit.
3. Keep or snapshot the old data volume for rollback.
4. Deploy matching client and server binaries.
5. Start the daemon and run authenticated `bellows doctor`.
6. If the protocol changed, start with an empty data directory. Old records are
   rejected rather than trusted.
7. Run one cold canary and one fresh-runner warm canary before restoring normal
   concurrency.

Rolling mixed-version deployments are unsupported. A protocol mismatch is a
clean miss or an explicit doctor failure, never authorization to restore an old
artifact.

## Capacity and recovery

Use `bellows stats` for blob bytes, record counts, candidates, and leases.

Collection is least recently used. Every publication and every reuse appends
one line to the store's access journal (`access/`); clients report reuse with
`POST /v1/actions/{static}/{action}/used`, best effort. A candidate's last use
is the later of its publication and its newest journal entry. Collection reads
every record once, counts blob references, then evicts the least recently used
records (a whole declared or archive record counts as one) until the blobs fit
the budget. A blob is deleted only when no remaining record references it.

- `bellows gc --max-mb MEBIBYTES --dry-run` reports the plan without changing
  anything: totals, a breakdown by protocol, output kind, checkout pinning, age
  of last use and crate, and what each would free. Always run it first.
- `bellows gc --max-mb MEBIBYTES` collects a server (`--server`), the
  daemonless cache (`--local`), or a store directory (`--store-dir`). A
  directory a running `bellowsd` owns accepts only `--dry-run`.
- `--min-protocol N` also evicts every compiler record older than protocol
  `N`, whatever the budget. Current clients can never use them.
- `bellowsd --max-store-gb GIB` (or `BELLOWS_MAX_STORE_GB`) collects to that
  budget every `--gc-interval-mins` (default 30). It is off unless set.

Collection applies its plan in batches of 256 under the store's mutation
lock, so builds keep publishing while it runs. It never deletes a blob that
was uploaded or offered again since it started, an unreferenced blob younger
than the one-hour publication grace, or a blob of a record published or
reused since it started. A zero-byte target can therefore remain above target
while uploads are active.

Compiler-cache failures are fail-open: the wrapper records the failure and
runs official rustc. A CI job should still fail closed at setup by running
`bellows doctor`, so an unintended cache outage is visible before expensive
work starts. If a daemon is unhealthy:

1. Preserve logs and `quarantine/` for diagnosis.
2. Stop the daemon cleanly.
3. Restart against the same volume and run `bellows doctor`.
4. If corruption persists, move the volume aside and start with an empty one.
5. Run cold and warm canaries; do not copy individual records into the new
   store.

Remote execution remains disabled unless `--enable-execution` is explicitly
set. Keep it disabled for the Manifold compiler-cache deployment.
